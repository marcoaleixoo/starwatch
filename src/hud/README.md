# HUD Module Staging

This directory will host the Babylon/NOA HUD widgets referenced in the manifesto:

- crosshair and selection feedback
- status panel for environment readouts
- toolbar inventory strip

Each widget should live in its own file (e.g. `crosshair.ts`) with shared constants colocated in `constants.ts`.
